	  <h2>Project Description</h2>
	  <p>The class theme is fantasy, so our team decided to make a game featuring a space explorer who has crash-landed onto a fantastical world. Our game follows our explorer as they wander through this world, in the form of a puzzle platformer.</p>

		  <li>During the week, the "AttachPlayer" and "Gravity" scripts were created. Gravity is used for changing the (currently) vertical gravity of the player between up and down. This will also rotate the player's orientation so that they are always right side up in regards to wherever gravity is pulling from. AttachPlayer is used for moving platforms, so that when the player touches the platform they will move with the platform, instead of just having the platform slide out from underneath them.</li>
		  <li>Additionally, the "Move", "Jump", and "CameraFollow" scripts were borrowed from Unity Playground.
