	  <h2>Project Description</h2>
	  <p>The class theme is fantasy, so our team decided to make a game featuring a space explorer who has crash-landed onto a fantastical world. Our game follows our explorer as they wander through this world, in the form of a puzzle platformer. We feel this fulfills the fantasy requirement as the world has fantastical elements, and many elements of the game are fantastical as well. While it may be perceived as science fiction, many science fiction works can also fall under the broad umbrella of fantasy, which really just refers to anything imagined or not based on reality.</p>
	  <p>The main inspiration of this game comes from 2D puzzle platformer games such as <em>Limbo</em> or <em>Inside</em>, both from Danish indie developer Playdead.
	  <p>Some of the major features of the game include:
	  <ul>
	  <li>Gravity switching in four directions: up, down, left, or right</li>
	  <li><em>More to come...</em></li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Development Log</h2>
		<p><u>May 8, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Development Log created.</li>
		  <li>Game planning Google doc created. This is used as a brainstorm, to keep track of our ideas.</li>
		  <li>Sprite/character sketches created. These include two versions of a character in a space suit.</li>
		  <li>Diagrams indicating how the gravity mechanic will work were also created.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 9, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Paper prototype created, in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. It includes info on the game's premise, the world design, the sprite/character design, the mechanics and gameplay, an example of what a puzzle might look like, assets used, and inspiration for the game idea.</li>
		  <li>Presentation of paper prototype.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 15, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>During the week, the "AttachPlayer" and "Gravity" scripts were created. Gravity is used for changing the (currently) vertical gravity of the player between up and down. This will also rotate the player's orientation so that they are always right side up in regards to wherever gravity is pulling from. AttachPlayer is used for moving platforms, so that when the player touches the platform they will move with the platform, instead of just having the platform slide out from underneath them.</li>
		  <li>Additionally, the "Move", "Jump", and "CameraFollow" scripts were borrowed from Unity Playground. The Move script was modified to restrict the player's max velocity. The CameraFollow script was modified so that it didn't follow the character so closely.</li>
		  <li>The asset pack we are using is the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/free-asset-2d-handcrafted-art-117049"> 2D Handcrafted Art Asset Pack</a>. This asset pack is mostly being used to create the scene/level background design, which we started building this week.</li>
		  <li>The "character" being used for now is just a 3D cube; a sprite has not yet been implemented.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 16, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Created the beginnings of code to implement a pendulum effect on future lantern sprites, so that they sway in the direction of the character's gravity.</li>
		  <li>Created an animation for a moving platform, and made it so the character does not slide off moving platform.</li>
		  <li>Added a block that the player can affect with their gravity.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 21, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Last week and earlier this week, four scenes were created. The first scene is a main menu that links to the core game and three digital protoypes. These three prototypes are the other new scenes.</li> 
		  <li>The first of them is the gravity protoype. It demonstrates the gravity swapping, the pendulum effect of a lantern on a chain, and another larger box that has more mass and is more resistant to the gravity pull. The lantern emits light and has particle effects that come off it to simulate cinders (this looks especially nice when it is swinging), and the chain is connected together with different join pieces so they move separately. However, this is not affected by gravity (the joint pieces disconnect and start to just float separately from each other), but the cube player and the other box can still have an effect on it by hitting it and getting it to swing. </li>
		  <li>The second scene demonstrates moving platforms. Specifically, the player's ability to stick on a platform while it moves, without sliding off. Also, two big platforms that smack together, which are part of a death zone trigger, and if you die youl will be respawned at the last checkpoint you passed.</li>
		  <li>The third scene illustrates not only up and down gravity, but left and right gravity as well.</li>
		  <li>Presentation of digital prototypes.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 22, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Yesterday the spacesuit character sprites were updated. They now incorporate two different animations: walking and jumping.
		  <li>Additionally, preparations for the Alpha Playtest began. The main level, gravity script, jump script, and deathzone script were all updated. Some additions were also made: new animations in main level, menuReturn script, sound script, and AudioManager script.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 23, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Finished up alpha work. This included adding an OptionsMenuManager script, adding a canvas to the main level, and adding a DeleteText script. Also finished implementing the AudioManager object which will manage the audio in the scene. Along with this, some audio files were imported, which are listed in the References section below.</li>
		  <li>Alpha Playtest session in class (Part 1).</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 28, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Adjusted camera slightly, so that more of the scene is visible.</li>
		  <li>Alpha Playtest session in class (Part 2).</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Playtest Feedback</h2>
		<p><u>Alpha Part 1</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Common complaints: Some of the mechanics were hard to see because the camera was too close. Something placed in the beginning to help showcase the gravity without the player dying would be helpful. Framerate is bad on WebGL (can't really do anything about that).</li>
		</ul>
