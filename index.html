	  <p>Team Name: The Pretty Little Princesses (Fantasy 19)</p>
	  <p>Team Members: Sarah Robbins, Dakota Sagredo, & Rachael Tustison</p>

	  <h2>Project Description</h2>
	  <p>The class theme is fantasy, so our team decided to make a game featuring a space explorer who has crash-landed onto a fantastical world. Our game follows our explorer as they wander through this world, in the form of a puzzle platformer.</p>

	  <h2>Development Log</h2>
		<p><u>May 8, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Development Log created.</li>
		  <li>Game planning Google doc created. This is used as a brainstorm, to keep track of our ideas.</li>
		  <li>Sprite/character sketches created. These include two versions of a character in a space suit.</li>
		  <li>Diagrams indicating how the gravity mechanic will work were also created.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 9, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Paper prototype created, in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. It included info on the game's premise, the world design, the sprite/character design, the mechanics and gameplay, an example of what a puzzle might look like, assets used, and inspiration for the game idea.</li>
		  <li>Presentation of paper prototype.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 15, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>During the week, the "AttachPlayer" and "Gravity" scripts were created. Gravity is used for changing the (currently) vertical gravity of the player between up and down. This will also rotate the player's orientation so that they are always right side up in regards to wherever gravity is pulling from. AttachPlayer is used for moving platforms, so that when the player touches the platform they will move with the platform, instead of just having the platform slide out from underneath them.</li>
		  <li>Additionally, the "Move", "Jump", and "CameraFollow" scripts were borrowed from Unity Playground. The Move script was modified to restrict the player's max velocity. The CameraFollow script was modified so that it didn't follow the character so closely.</li>
		  <li>The asset pack we are using is the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/free-asset-2d-handcrafted-art-117049"> 2D Handcrafted Art Asset Pack</a>. This asset pack is mostly being used to create the scene/level background design, which we started building this week.</li>
		  <li>The "character" being used for now is just a 3D cube; a sprite has not yet been implemented.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>May 16, 2019</u></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Created the beginnings of code to implement a pendulum effect on future lantern sprites, so that they sway in the direction of the character's gravity.</li>
		  <li>Presentation of digital prototypes.</li>
		</ul>
